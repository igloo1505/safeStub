# To Do

- [x] Assign appropriate auth tokens on initial creation of account.
- [ ] Handle password reset through an email link.
- [ ] Refresh auth tokens on client page requests, not just API calls.
- [ ] Adjust primereact colors to reflect daisyui colors when back on wifi and can check syntax.
  - [ ] If the above approach doesn't work, use an entirely different calendar component. This should be the first approach, since prime react is importing **wayyyy** more css and javascript then is actually needed.

## Up Next

1. Find new calendar component that can be adjusted to fit theme and avoid the mountains of unnecessary imports.
2. Events search result item.
3. A completely alternative light mode hero section. Grab some stuff from Meraki before leaving wifi.
