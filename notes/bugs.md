# Bugs

While you're crusing around with the app, take note of anything that doesn't behave the way it's supposed to. Ideally, create a note with a 'how to reproduce' line so I can replicate it. That's not always possible and sometimes why things happen isn't super obvious, but if you can explain how to reproduce the bug that's ideal.
